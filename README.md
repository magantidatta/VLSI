🔧 # VLSI Design & Verification Repository

This repository contains a curated collection of VLSI design projects, implementation notes, and learning resources, developed as part of my academic and hands-on experience in VLSI Design and Semiconductor Engineering.

It includes:

📐 CMOS analog & digital design projects (Op-Amps, Inverters, RTL-based systems)

🧠 RTL design and functional verification concepts using Verilog/SystemVerilog

⚡ Low-power and leakage optimization techniques

🧪 SPICE-based simulations and EDA tool workflows

📊 FPGA-based real-time implementations

📝 Concise VLSI notes covering core topics useful for interviews, exams, and industry preparation

This repository is intended to serve as a living portfolio and a structured knowledge base for VLSI fundamentals, practical design methodologies, and semiconductor industry readiness.
