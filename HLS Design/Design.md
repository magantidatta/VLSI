# High-Level Synthesis (HLS) Design Using Vitis HLS  
## Full Adder Implementation and Verification

---

## Introduction

High-Level Synthesis (HLS) is a modern digital design methodology that allows designers to describe hardware functionality using high-level programming languages such as C or C++. The HLS tool automatically converts this high-level description into synthesizable Register Transfer Level (RTL) code, significantly reducing design complexity and development time.

This project demonstrates the complete HLS design flow using **Vitis HLS**, with a **Full Adder** implemented as a representative example. The aim is to understand how algorithm-level C++ code is translated into hardware and verified at both C and RTL levels.

## Why High-Level Synthesis Is Important

Traditional RTL design using Verilog or VHDL requires explicit handling of clocks, registers, and control logic. While this approach provides fine-grained control, it becomes time-consuming and difficult to scale for complex designs.

High-Level Synthesis offers the following advantages:

- Higher abstraction level for hardware design  
- Faster design and verification cycles  
- Early functional validation using C simulation  
- Automatic generation of synthesizable RTL  
- Improved productivity and reduced manual coding errors  
- Easy scalability to larger and more complex designs  

HLS is widely used in FPGA acceleration, system-on-chip (SoC) design, and hardware/software co-design.

## Project Objective

The objectives of this project are:

- To understand the complete HLS design flow using Vitis HLS  
- To implement a basic digital logic block (Full Adder) in C++  
- To verify functionality using a C++ testbench  
- To synthesize the design into Verilog RTL  
- To analyze the structure of HLS-generated RTL  
- To verify the design using RTL simulation and waveform analysis

## Tools and Platform

- Vitis HLS 2023.1  
- Vivado Design Suite  
- Target FPGA Board: Basys3 (Artix-7)

## Design Overview

The Full Adder is a fundamental combinational logic circuit that adds three 1-bit inputs and produces a sum and a carry output. In this project, the Full Adder is described using C++ code and synthesized using Vitis HLS.

The project includes:
- C++ design code  
- C++ testbench for functional verification  
- Synthesized Verilog RTL  
- RTL simulation and waveform analysis  
- Post-implementation verification in Vivado

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, the following concepts are learned:

- Writing synthesizable C++ code for HLS  
- Creating and using C++ testbenches  
- Performing C-level functional verification  
- Understanding HLS control and handshake signals  
- Analyzing auto-generated RTL code  
- Performing RTL simulation and waveform analysis  
- Integrating HLS-generated RTL into Vivado

## Key Observation

Although the Full Adder is a simple combinational circuit, the RTL generated by Vitis HLS includes additional control and handshake signals such as `ap_start`, `ap_done`, and output valid signals. This demonstrates how HLS automatically wraps user logic with control infrastructure, which becomes essential for larger and more complex hardware designs.

## Target Audience

This project is intended for:

- Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying VLSI, FPGA design, or embedded systems  
- Beginners transitioning from software programming (C/C++) to hardware design  
- FPGA and RTL designers seeking an introduction to High-Level Synthesis  
- Verification engineers interested in understanding HLS-generated RTL  
- Researchers, interns, and educators working on FPGA-based prototyping  

The simplicity of the Full Adder makes this project an ideal starting point before moving on to more advanced HLS-based designs.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how High-Level Synthesis simplifies the hardware design process by enabling designers to work at a higher abstraction level while still producing efficient, synthesizable RTL. Using Vitis HLS, a C++ description of a Full Adder was successfully converted into Verilog, verified through simulation, and integrated into an FPGA design flow.

The methodology presented here can be extended to more complex digital systems such as multi-bit adders, communication protocols, and hardware accelerators.
