# Real-Time Weather Classification System using FPGA

## Problem Statement
Many regions lack reliable internet connectivity and consistent power supply, making it difficult to deploy
conventional weather monitoring systems that depend on processors, cloud services, or complex embedded
software. To overcome this limitation, this project presents a **fully offline, hardware-based weather
classification system implemented on FPGA**.

---

## Objectives
- Implement a **real-time weather classification system** that operates completely offline
- Train a machine learning classifier and extract decision thresholds for **hardware realization**
- Utilize a **low-cost DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor** for efficient weather classification

---

## Methodology

### Step 1: Dataset Collection
Weather data containing temperature and humidity readings is collected and prepared for training the
machine learning model.

### Step 2: Training the Decision Tree Model
A **Decision Tree classifier** is trained using Python to categorize weather conditions such as:
- Clear
- Overcast
- Rain partially cloudy
- Partially cloudy
- Rain overcast

### Step 3: Extracting Thresholds for Hardware Deployment
Decision boundaries and threshold values generated by the trained model are extracted for
hardware implementation.

### Step 4: Verilog Module Implementation
The extracted thresholds are manually encoded as **if–else conditions in Verilog**, forming the
weather classification logic suitable for FPGA deployment.

### Step 5: Simulation and Verification
The Verilog-based weather classification module is simulated to verify correct operation for
various temperature and humidity input combinations.

### Step 6: Real-Time FPGA Implementation
The verified design is implemented on the **Basys3 FPGA board** and interfaced with the **DHT11 sensor**.
Classification results are displayed on an **LCD** and simultaneously transmitted to a PC using
**UART (PuTTY terminal)** for real-time monitoring.

## RTL Architecture
The RTL design consists of four main Verilog modules:

- **dht11_interface**  
  Reads the 40-bit data frame from the DHT11 sensor and extracts temperature and humidity values.

- **weather_classifier**  
  Determines the current weather condition based on the embedded decision logic.

- **lcd_display**  
  Displays temperature, humidity, and classified weather on an LCD.

- **uart_display**  
  Transmits temperature, humidity, and weather information to a PC through UART for real-time monitoring.

This architecture enables **fully offline, hardware-based weather classification** without reliance
on external processors or cloud services.

## System Operation
In real-time operation, the **DHT11 sensor** captures temperature and humidity data, which is processed by
the **Basys3 FPGA** using Verilog-based classification logic. The classified weather information is
displayed on an LCD through a level shifter and simultaneously sent to a PC via the **PuTTY terminal**.

---

## Simulation Results
Simulation verifies the Verilog-based weather classification logic using multiple input test frames.
At the first clock edge, temperature and humidity values are extracted, and at the subsequent clock edge,
the corresponding weather classification result is generated. Weather conditions are encoded to ensure
clear visualization in the waveform.

## Tools and Technologies
- **FPGA Board:** Basys3
- **HDL:** Verilog
- **Sensor:** DHT11 (Temperature and Humidity)
- **Simulation Tool:** ModelSim / Vivado Simulator

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an effective **offline, FPGA-based weather classification system** by
combining machine learning concepts with hardware design. By extracting decision logic from a trained
model and implementing it directly in Verilog, the system eliminates the need for processors, cloud
connectivity, and complex software, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.
